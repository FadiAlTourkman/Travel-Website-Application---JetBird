# Travel-Website-Application-JetBird
Developed a sophisticated travel website utilizing HTML and CSS, meticulously designed to showcase a diverse array of countries as attractive travel destinations. Each country profile encapsulates essential information, including flight pricing, popular destinations, and notable features. The website's foundation is bolstered by a custom-built API that I meticulously constructed, orchestrating seamless data retrieval and management. This data is structured in a JSON file format, securely stored in the cloud. Leveraging the capabilities of JavaScript and employing the fetch API, I dynamically present this rich data on the webpage, providing an engaging and interactive user experience.
